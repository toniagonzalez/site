                 <p>In Portland, Oregon specialty coffee is a competitive field. The shops that are most successful also roast their own coffee and have a successful wholesale business.  The company needed to update their site after paring down to one location. The redesign aim is to generate more retail and wholesale business. This proposed redesign of the Red E Cafe mobile and web sites looks to bring more attention to their presence as a roaster as well as a cafe and gallery.

              <p class="panel-text">The whole site ideation process revolved around a quote that is featured prominently throughout the cafe. “Un-compromised respect for the coffee and for the people who handle it; from the farm to the cup, from us to you.” The site visually follows the steps of sourcing coffee from the farm, roasting the beans, and preparing coffee in the cafe for patrons. The use of a primary color pallet connotes life, action, appetite and energy.</p>

             <div class="panel-section col-2">    
              <p class="panel-text">The current site serves an informational purpose. It answers the question where is the cafe? This question can be easily answered in a general internet search. The updated mobile site promotes immediate engagement and answers the question; How would you like to interact with this platform? Would you like to Shop? Would you like to explore the Gallery? The empty shopping cart at the screen also signals purchases to be made.</p>

              <p>In creating the online store I faced the challenge of visually representing seasonal merchandise. Should the offerings be text based in a table, photo based or icon based?  I created a general icon for all of the offerings with a variable text component for both the mobile and web layouts.</p>

              <p class="panel-text">The web redesign broadly mirrors the current site. The Coffee Services and Online Store tab of the current site were made into a sub-menu on the redesign. The sub-meun includes the headings Coffee, Catering, Wholesale, as well as the Shopping Cart icon. The quote is placed front and center along with parallel images to set the tone for the site.</p>

                 <p>The State of Oregon has a wealth of parks and trails located throughout the state. This mobile app concept would afford the user access to trail locations, accommodations and maps while on the go.  Currently, it is imperative to download or screenshot directions and camp information before leaving cell service. This app would allow access to the parks and trail databases while offline and on the road. Read more about to learn about the design process.

Would this be a social app that shares ratings of parks and insider secrets or purely an informational tool to navigate the Oregon Parks and trails throughout the state. I decided to create the later. There are ample forums that discuss the challenges or surprises to be discovered while in nature. The goal of this app concept was clear  organized access to Oregon Parks and Trails database found on the Oregon government site.</p>

When the map search option, there is a “You are Here” option that provides a GPS location offline in a topographical map.  This general flow of the app can be seen in this Find a Park search option. There would also be an option to save favorite locations within the app.</p>

                     <p>Maintaining brand cohesiveness across languages can be a challenge for brands reliant upon recognition by their typography.  This is especially a challenge when the brand is transitioning from a character based language to a latin based language or vice-versa. This redesign of the Vogue Arabia site grapples with this challenge.  Read more to learn about the design process.</p>

                  <p class="panel-text">The Vogue-US site uses the contrast of all caps and mixed case in varying sizes to create the feel of the site. The Arabic language has no capital or lower case letters and reads right to left. The current Vogue Arabia web page shows no Arabic in the initial home screen. In my design I decided to treat the word Vogue as an image logo and make the Arabic language visible from the initial home page.</p>
